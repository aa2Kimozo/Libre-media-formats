| --------- | --------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gzip**  | `.gz`     | GPL                 | Widely used compression format based on DEFLATE, often used with TAR for `.tar.gz` archives.                            |
| **Bzip2** | `.bz2`    | BSD                 | Compression format known for better compression ratios than gzip but slower.                                            |
| **XZ**    | `.xz`     | Public Domain / GPL | Uses LZMA2 algorithm; offers high compression ratios and is used with TAR for `.tar.xz`.                                |
| **7z**    | `.7z`     | LGPL                | Open-source compression format, supports multiple algorithms, including LZMA and LZMA2, offering very high compression. |
| **Zstd**  | `.zst`    | BSD (Libre)         | Fast, modern compression algorithm providing a balance between speed and compression ratio.                             |
| **LZ4**   | `.lz4`    | BSD                 | Focuses on speed with high compression rates, often used in real-time systems.                                          |
| **Lzip**  | `.lz`     | GPL                 | Compression format using LZMA, designed for high compression with integrity checking.                                   |
| **LZMA**  | `.lzma`   | Public Domain       | High compression ratio format; the algorithm is used in 7z and other open formats.                                      |
| **ZOO**   | `.zoo`    | Public Domain       | Older compression format, less common today but still used in niche communities.                                        |
